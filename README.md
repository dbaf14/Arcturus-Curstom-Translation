# üåê Arcturus Translation Project

Since the English Translation based on the japanese version of **Arcturus** became available in 2017, this repository aims to provide the same opportunity for players of the **original Korean version** ‚Äî starting with a **German translation** as an example.

This project also serves as a **step-by-step guide** to help you translate the game into other languages, such as **French, Spanish**, and beyond.

## üìÅ Which Files Need to Be Edited?

To localize Arcturus, you'll primarily work with the contents of the `data.pak` file, located in the **root directory** after installation. Additionally, some menus in `Arcexe.exe` can be modified using a **hex editor**.

You can **fully unpack `data.pak`** using a special version of **GrfWiz.exe** or [GrfUnpack](https://github.com/exectails/GrfUnpack.git).

### Key File Types:

- **`.SCR`** ‚Äì Scripts for NPC movements, item behavior, dialogues, etc.  
  Not encrypted; editable by replacing the text directly.

- **`.TXT`** ‚Äì Plain text databases (e.g., skills, maps, items).  
  Simple text replacement possible.

- **`.DAT`** ‚Äì Specifically `arcfont.dat`, `arcfonte.dat`, and `arcfonth.dat`.  
  These files contain all displayable characters. For Western languages, edit `arcfonte.dat` to enable special characters.  
  The others contain Korean Hangul and Chinese Hanja characters.

- **`.RSA`** ‚Äì Contains cutscene dialogue and events for protagonists and NPCs.  
  These are **encrypted** and must be decrypted before editing and encrypted again afterward.

For `.RSA` files, use [Arcturus decrsa/encrsa](https://cyberwarriorx.com/translation-utilities):  
üîß `DECRSA` (decrypt) & `ENCRSA` (encrypt)

> üìù *Note: Other file types may also contain text. This list will be updated over time.*

## üõ† How to Edit `.SCR` and `.TXT` Files

The game uses the **EUC-KR encoding**, so use a text editor like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) that supports it to view and edit text properly or [dbaf14's Arcturus Translation Tool](arctranslationtool) (Be sure to have a legend.ini-file next to the executable to use symbol replacement)

In `.SCR` and `.RSA` files, you‚Äôll find text using these commands:

>`say` " text here "

>`monologue` " thought bubble text "

>`shout` " jagged speech bubble text "

>`header` " screen overlay text "


Additional `.SCR` commands:

>`msg` " message box text "

>`choose` "option 1" "option 2"

>`getitem` itemname
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful when renaming items. You can leave the internal ID in Korean and only change the **display name**.

Item names can be edited in:  
`data/diary/item.txt`

## üîê How to Edit `.RSA` Files

1. **Decrypt** using the `DECRSA` tool:
   - Drag & drop `test.rsa` onto `decrsa.exe` ‚Üí Produces `test.txt`
   - Edit `test.txt` with Notepad++ (EUC-KR encoding) or [dbaf14's Arcturus Translation Tool](arctranslationtool) 

2. **Encrypt** using the `ENCRSA` tool:
   ```bash
   c:/tool/encrsa test.txt test.rsa

This will overwrite or create a new test.rsa, which can then be placed back in /data.

üß† RSA files use the following text triggers as `.SCR` files:

>`say` " text here "

>`monologue` " thought bubble text "

>`shout` " jagged speech bubble text "

>`header` " screen overlay text "


## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Edit `arcfonte.dat` (Font File)

To display **special characters** in Western languages, you‚Äôll need to edit `arcfonte.dat` using a font editor like [dbaf14's Arcturus Fonttool](fontedit) (configured to read 18 bytes per row).

Replace unused characters with your desired special characters.  
Here is a sample character mapping used for the German translation:

| Character | Replaces |
|-----------|----------|
| `@`       | √Ñ        |
| `=`       | √§        |
| `#`       | √ñ        |
| `/`       | √∂        |
| `$`       | √ú        |
| `>`       | √º        |
| `+`       | √ü        |

> Example:  
To display

> **"Ich hei√üe Sizz und bin kein M√§dchen"**

 , you'd write:
  
> **"Ich hei+e Sizz und bin kein M=dchen"**

### FontEdit Color Codes:
- `00` ‚Äì Transparent (background)
- `FF` ‚Äì Black
- `C0` ‚Äì Dark Gray
- `A0` ‚Äì Light Gray
- `80` ‚Äì Very Light Gray

Once finished, save the file and place it in the `/data` directory.  
Note: Not all glyphs/fields in `arcfonte.dat` are used by the game.

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Use dbaf14's Arcturus Translation Tool

To use [dbaf14's Arcturus Translation Tool](arctranslationtool), simply **load a `.SCR` file** or a **decrypted `.TXT` (RSA) file**, and begin editing the text as needed.

Once you're done, click 
**`<TranslateSave<`** to write your changes **directly back to the original file**.

> ‚úÖ **Symbol replacement** is handled automatically ‚Äî just make sure that the `legend.ini` file is placed in the **same directory** as the tool's executable.

üîÑ **Only the lines you edit will be written back**, allowing you to translate comfortably without affecting the rest of the file.
